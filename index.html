    <h1>The Protecting Elections Toolkit</h1>
    <p>
      The Protecting Elections Toolkit (hereafter the Toolkit) is the result of
      an effort to consolidate existing resources for protecting electoral
      integrity through a broad review of academic and grey literature. The
      current version is a pilot and will be subject to amendments and updates
      over the upcoming two years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Toolkit is developed as a data table that allows users to identify and
      customize existing remedies based on:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>electoral challenges addressed</li>
      <li>electoral integrity securities</li>
      <li>timing of intervention</li>
      <li>focus of capacity development</li>
      <li>gender sensitivity</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For more information on the categories, the literature review methodology
      and material selection, please consult the Toolkit narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      By clicking on the title of a resource the user will open a link to the
      relevant article or website in a new tab. Users that are looking for a
      particular type of resource will be able to filter the database based on
      the above categories using the control panel above the table. The user
      specifies values for any or all of the categories, then clicks "Filter,"
      and only resources that match those specifications will be shown. More
      detailed information can be found in the User's Manual.
